        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is easily multiplied for a crowd. Everyone in my family asks me to bring this <br>
            to our functions. I even make it for weddings. Sometimes I use a mixture of different <br>
            kinds of pasta, especially if I only have a little of this kind or that. Depending on what <br> 
            type of macaroni used, more dressing may be required. <br>
            The recipe calls for red onion, but sweet onion is great, too.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package macaroni</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground mustard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sweet pickle juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons celery seed</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped red onion</li>
            <li>½ cup pimento-stuffed green olives</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped sweet pickle</li>
            <li>2 carrots, grated</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until al dente. Drain; rinse with cold water.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, place eggs in a saucepan, and fill with enough cold water to cover eggs completely by about 1 inch. <br>
            Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 20 minutes. <br>
            Immediately remove from hot water and cool in an ice water bath. When cool enough to handle, peel and chop eggs.</p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>In a medium bowl, mix together mayonnaise, sour cream, dry mustard, sweet pickle juice, and celery seed. <br>
        Season with salt and black pepper.</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>In a large bowl, combine drained pasta, celery, onion, olives, sweet pickles, carrots, green pepper, and chopped eggs. <br>
        Stir in dressing, and mix well. Refrigerate before serving.</p>
